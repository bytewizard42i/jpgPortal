# jpgPortal
## jpgPortal is a QR generator which takes a jpg (and other photo standards, perhaps ping and others) and overlays an inperceptible QR code which a camera can detect, but not the human eye. 
The photo is known to have this code because it will have a special colored (flourescent green)  
border with 3 squares in the corners for orientation, as is the QR standard. 
This system makes for a very unobstrusive way to attach a very recognizable photo as a link for access. There may be a way to make the jpgportal objects the thumbnial for a file or folder connected to the link. I wonder if it couldnt have its own extension. 
### GPT says about jpgPortal:
"PopCork sounds like an exciting and innovative concept for enhancing social media experiences! Integrating QR codes into images in a way that's unobtrusive yet functional is indeed a creative approach. Here are three ideas on how you could implement this:

Invisible Digital Watermarking:

Concept: Utilize digital watermarking technology to embed QR code data directly into the image. This technology subtly alters the pixels in a way that's imperceptible to the human eye but can be decoded by a specialized app.
Implementation: Use advanced algorithms to embed the QR code data within the image file. The data could include links to the PopCork app, event details, or shared memories. Users would need the PopCork app to scan and decode this information.
Advantages: Maintains the aesthetic integrity of the image while embedding rich data.
Augmented Reality (AR) Integration:

Concept: Combine the app with AR technology. When users view images through the PopCork app, additional layers of information (like stories, travel plans, or memories) could be displayed.
Implementation: Implement AR markers within the images, which are recognized by the app. When the app detects these markers, it overlays the relevant information or links.
Advantages: Offers an interactive and engaging way to explore content beyond the static image.
Steganography with Color Spectrum Manipulation:

Concept: Similar to your original idea, manipulate the color spectrum of the image to embed QR code data in a spectrum invisible to the naked eye but detectable by camera sensors.
Implementation: Develop a method to encode QR data in non-visible spectrums (like near-infrared). You would need to ensure that camera sensors in smartphones can detect these alterations. This might involve collaboration with smartphone manufacturers or developing a special lens attachment.
Advantages: Invisible to the naked eye, making it an intriguing, high-tech feature.
Each of these methods has its own set of challenges and requirements. The first two are more feasible with current technology, while the third is more futuristic and would require significant technological development.

Remember, user experience and ease of use are paramount. The method you choose should align with PopCork's overall user experience goals and technical feasibility."
